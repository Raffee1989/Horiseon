## HTML-CSS-Git | Code Refactor
### Description:
I was provided with material like (HTML-CSS-Git) and some assets for an existing Horiseon website. My job was to refactor their site and make sure it is more accessible. Web accessibility is one of the most important topics in designing websites. Each website should be accessible for all  groups of people, especially people with disability. Therefore I was given some list of specific criteria to make this happen. 

 ### Specific Criteria 
* Webpage Accessibility Standards
    * Semantic order for HTML & CSS elements
    * Order the CSS logical structure independent of styling and positioning
    * Add Alt attributes for all the images
    * Order the heading attributes in sequential order
    * Finds a concise, descriptive title for the website
#

### Additional Requirements
Aside from the above criteria, I had to modify each HTML & CSS codes to make sure it runs as expected, therefore; 
* The Search Engine Optimization link was not working properly, so I had to define an ID for it. 
* I consolidated the CSS selectors and properties. 
* I cleaned up some of the codes HTML and CSS files by removing multiple div selectors and class selectors with longer names, so it looks simpler and easier to read without making any changes or error to the appearance of the website. 
* I commented on each HTML and CSS elements properly. 
* I created a repository in GITHub with a unique name that contains all the materials.
* The website had to deploy and load at live URL without any errors. 
 #
### Mock-Up
Below is the final appearance of the website.
